# TJBusApp

Hello! We're currently trying to build an application that can track buses at
TJ. As of October 2016, this project is currently being worked on by Mr. Kosek's
sixth period mobile and signal processing classes. It was Mr. Kosek that
suggested this project to us.

Most of the current activity is happening in the `server` folder. Eventually,
the goal is to build an Android app that can interface with the API as part of
the Mobile App Development class.

We have a
[Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4pKCnO2NaBvek5CdzBWOUgwdzg?usp=sharing)
that we're using for planning purposes.
